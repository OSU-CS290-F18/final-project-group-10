# final-project-group-10
For our final project, we chose to do a calculator page. We wanted the calculator to be sleek and aesthetically appealing, while still being functional and usable. We created a calculator with all of the basic arithmetic functions you may need while computing basic algebra. 

For the MongoDB portion, we implemented a formula page where users can add formulas they want to remember and remove ones they don't need anymore. This formula input is stored in a MongoDB database. Both webpages are served using Node.js.
